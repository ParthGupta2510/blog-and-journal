                <strong>Dear Readers,</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                This is my first ever attempt at writing a journal. I plan upon writing all of my experiences and my perspective towards my life and its associated problems! So here we go:
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="drop-cap">I</span>t were the ‘Golden Days’ of lockdown, when I actually got diverted to activities other than studying. I am not trying to say that I was very studious before the pandemic, all I am trying to convey is that typical JEE aspirants don’t get much liberty to explore other activities and I was one of them. The fact that I am stating the lockdown period of the year 2020 as ‘Golden Days’ might make you think that I had an awesome time at home! But it is far from being the truth.
            </p>
            <p>
                The educational institutions got closed as a preventive measure against the new Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) on 15th March 2020. I clearly remember the extent of joy and relief that this news gave me since I had my physics exam of class 11 scheduled on 16th March and I had barely prepared for it. Later, all the exams were cancelled and the latter half of the month went by in just ‘trying’ to adjust to the new life at home. It was not easy, with a sudden change in the lifestyle, all the schedules got disturbed.
            </p>
            <p>
                The month of April 2020, introduced us all to online learning, using various digital platforms like Zoom, Google Meet etc. Classes resumed, and studies began again, but something was different this time. It did not feel normal at all, being locked in one room, all alone, and hearing the teacher while copying down the notes from the virtual whiteboard. The atmosphere that I once used to enjoy in offline classes, was no longer present and with the routine disturbed already, the very obvious happened. My academic performance went down, partly taking along with it, my interest in studies. Such was the case of a lot of students out there, not just me.
            </p>
            <p>
                Adding to it was the exposure to all the different activities that began trending over the internet, the diversion that I mentioned. I began investing more time into various other activities like vlogging, reading novels, cooking, gardening etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Life just seemed too happy, with the availability of free time to explore those activities.
            </p>
            <p>
                But the nature of life is quite fascinating indeed, because it does not let you stop. It keeps you moving, neither will it allow you to be sad for too long, nor will it let you stay happy for more than a certain amount of time. This leads to the ups and downs in life!
            </p>
            <p>
                And such was the case with me as well. That happiness slowly began fading as the outcome of my lowered interest in study and reduced study hours became visible in the result of the weekly tests.
            </p>
