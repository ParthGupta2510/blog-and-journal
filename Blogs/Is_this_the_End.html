            <strong>Dear Readers,</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            The rest of the Lockdown period was mostly monotonous and before I write more about it, I have something
            else to share. What I have today, is a theory, which is not mine, but I came across this and I think not
            many of you out there might be aware of this. So here we go:
        </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            <span class="drop-cap">A</span>t the midnight (00:00 hour) of 17th-18th February 3102 BCE, Lord Krishna
            departed from Earth to the Vaikunth Lok. Before you all get confused as to why I am telling you this, let me
            introduce you, if not already aware, to the Hindu Cosmology. A Yug Cycle is a cyclic age in Hindu Cosmology.
            Each cycle lasts for 12,000 divine years, where one divine year or one year of god is equivalent to 360
            solar or human years, and thus a Yug can be calculated to go on for a span of 4,320,000 human years. This
            cycle repeats four Yug (world ages): Satya Yug, Treta Yug, Dvapar Yug, and Kali Yug. Each Yug has a dawn and
            a dusk, preceding and succeeding it respectively. The four Yug have their own significance, but not getting
            into all the details, lets stick to Kali Yug, our present age.
        </p>
        <p>
            The departure of Lord Krishna marked the end of the Dvapar Yug and the beginning of the Kali Yug. According
            to the Vedic Puran, Kali Yug is the worst of all the fours Yugs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, the Kali Yug is the last Yug of a Yug Cycle and it is believed that then the tenth and the last Avatar
            of Lord Vishnu, Lord Kalki will descend on Earth, to punish the Evil and restore peace on this planet. After
            this the Kali Yug will end and will lead to the beginning of another Yug Cycle. For this, a Pralay will
            occur and all the civilizations will degenerate or be destroyed. It will be the end of the universe and lead
            to a fresh start!
        </p>
        <p>
            I know it sounds crazy and scary and I, myself, didn’t believe much in these talks, until I came across the
            attributes that have been mentioned with regard to the Kali Yug in the Mahabharat written by Ved Vyas.
            Following are a few of them :
        <ul class="blog2-list">
            <li>Rulers will become unreasonable; they will levy taxes unfairly and will no longer see it as their duty
                to protect their subjects: they will become a danger to the world.</li>
            <li>Sin will increase exponentially.</li>
            <li>People will become addicted to intoxicating drinks and drugs.</li>
            <li>Gurus will no longer be respected.</li>
            <li>Weather and environment will degrade with time and frequent and unpredictable rainfalls will happen.
            </li>
            <li>The powerful people will dominate the poor people.</li>
            <li>Many diseases will spread.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Even if one does not believe in the Hindu Scriptures, he/she will agree that the current situation is no
            better than what is mentioned, if not worse. Thus, I feel that this is indeed the Kali Yug. So, is the end
            here?
        </p>
        <p>
            We know that the Corona Virus is mutating at an alarming rate and there are very less chances of us getting
            rid of this virus from our lives. Can we learn to live in the ‘new’ normal or is the end here?
        </p>
        <p>
            There is all sorts of negativity out there and all types of people, people who will make use of someone
            else’s compulsions, who will cheat their way ahead, who will just do anything to get power. So is the
            Humanity still alive out there or is the end here?
        </p>
        <p>
            Upon digging up more information about the Kali Yug, I found that out of the 12,000 divine years, Kali Yug
            makes up only 1000 divine years with a 100 divine years making up the dawn of Kali Yug (Kali Yug Sandhya)
            and another 100 years makes up the dusk. This adds up tp 1200 divine years, equivalent to 432,000 solar
            years. and to give you a sigh of relief, we are only 5000 years into this Age, didn’t even cross the Dawn
            age (which spans about 36,000 solar years). So, there is no need to worry much as the end is far far away.
        </p>
        <div class="div-for-blog-img" id="blog2-flower-pic">

        </div>
        <p>
            If you are thinking that is all that I wanted to convey, then you are wrong. The theory I was talking about
            starts here.
        </p>
        <p>
            We already know how much of a negative and Adharmic (Evil) the society has become and what is important to
            note here, is that this is just the beginning. There is a lot to come. The great people of the past knew it
            all along, that this time would come, and even their greatness could not do anything to stop this. Someone
            who can actually do something about this is YOU, and me and everyone out there! We, who live in this age,
            are the only ones who can do something about this. We cannot stop it forever, it is destined and it will
            happen, we can just help in slowing down the process.
        </p>
        <p>
            If each and everyone of us, who is capable, helps out someone in a way that can bring a smile to their face,
            or at least relieve them of a tiny amount of their worries and tension, that can keep the humanity alive.
            There are many people who are already working on this and all we have to do is increase the numbers, while
            making sure that we stay in out limit and stay safe!
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s alright if you can’t physically reach out to help others, the least that you can do is not to spread
            negativity or hatred and share this idea with others. Every small step counts and it matters!
        </p>

            Thanks...
