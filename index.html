        <h2>Welcome to My Blog & Journal</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            My first attempt to write a Journal. To many of you, the word Journal might give the idea that it contains
            all about my personal life. I won’t say that you are wrong but in this Blog/Journal of mine, I will present
            to you all the amazing experiences that I gain, as well as my perspective towards life.
        </p>
        <p>
            One’s own mistakes still remain the best teacher. But as said by Eleanor Roosevelt, “Learn from the mistakes
            of others. You can’t live long enough to make them all yourself.” This is one reason as to why you should
            consider investing your time in reading my blogs. Another one being, who does not like to laugh at others’
            stupidity (lol!)
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope you enjoy my work and I will be very happy if my work helps you, even in any tiniest way.
        </p>

            Thanks!

        <p>
            I would like to express my gratitude to all the people in my life. You may not find your mention in the
            blog, but I owe all my experiences of life to you all, because it was your presence that made all the events
            memorable.
